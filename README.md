# Binarizing the Convolutional Neural Networks in an End to End Fashion
Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  have  become the state of the art in several object recognition and object classification tasks.  However, using CNNs onresource constrained devices in real-time is limited by the inference time due to huge computational overload such asmultiplications in 2-D conv layers.  An obvious way to re-duce the complexity is to use XNOR networks. In thesenetworks, both weights and inputs to the convolutional lay-ers are binarised.  This replaces the traditional multiplications with binary operations and then using a scalar to ap-proximate a floating point multiplication resulting in significant speedup.
