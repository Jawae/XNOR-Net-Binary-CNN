This requires Pytorch to be installed on the system. Uses CPU currently for 
training. Changes can be made in variable use_cuda to enable GPU training

Pytorch Installation
pip install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch-1.0.0-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl
pip install torchvision 

Requirements
Python 2.7
numpy
matplotlib

Running the code
#Download the Lenet in the data folder.

# make a directory where you want to save the models
mkdir -p models/lenet/run_14

# Run the training
python train_mnist_binarize_weights_v4.py -s models/lenet/run_14 

# Run the training while saving the log
python train_mnist_binarize_weights_v4.py -s models/lenet/run_14 | tee models/lenet/run_14/run_14.log

# Plotting the filters
python visualize_mnist_v5.py
